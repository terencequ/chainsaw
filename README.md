# Chainsaw

Chainsaw is a CSS library for my personal use. Written in [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), this library is customisable, has a wide range of helper classes, and contributes to providing a unique style that I can employ in all my websites.

*Me, looking at my ugly websites I made before learning CSS properly...*

If anyone ever finds this, hope this brings you some value!


## Importing the stylesheet

Importing the stylesheet into your website is easy. Make sure you have a copy of the ```.css``` file generated by the repository.
Place it in a ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">```, and everything should be good to go.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- Import the CSS stylesheet. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/index.css">
    <title>Chainsaw Display Website</title>
</head>

<body>
...
...
...
</body>
</html>
```

## Theming

This ```.css``` library uses SASS mixins to generate styling for a bunch of pre-made themes. If you have access to the source ```.scss``` code, you can create your own theme maps.
To use the maps, your html ```<body>``` must be structured like so:

```html
<!-- Body needs to have a 'color-theme-...' class, and a 'text-theme-...' class. -->
<body class="color-theme-light text-theme-goofy">
    <div class="chainsaw-container">
        ...
    </div>
</body>
```

There needs to be a **color theme** class, and a **text theme** class, and one ```div``` must be made to wrap the entire website's contents, with the class ```chainsaw-container```.

- Color theme class must be a class on the ```<body>```, and the naming follows ```color-theme-{theme key}```.
- Text theme class must be a class on the ```<body>```, and the naming follows ```text-theme-{theme key}```.

See all available theme types in ```src/core/_themes.scss```.
